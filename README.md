# Markdown Editor

A simple Markdown editor with a live preview built using React. This application allows users to write markdown text in an editor and instantly preview the formatted output. The editor also supports dark mode and a manual refresh button for updating the preview.

## Features

- **Live Markdown Preview**: See the rendered markdown as you type.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for a better editing experience.
- **Manual Refresh Option**: If real-time updates are not working, use the refresh button to manually update the preview.
- **Scrollable Editor and Preview**: Both the editor and preview panes are scrollable without displaying scrollbars.
